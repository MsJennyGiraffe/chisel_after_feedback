# chisel

Chisel turns markdown format into html format by taking in a file, and outputting into a seperate file.

You can find the project spec [here](https://github.com/turingschool/curriculum/blob/master/source/projects/chisel.markdown)

### Running the program

* git clone the project into a directory

* cd into the file directory within the project directory

    git clone git@github.com:MsJennyGiraffe/chisel_after_feedback.git
s
    cd ~/chisel_after_feedback/files

Run the program from the files folder by running the main chisel file in the lib folder with the input file as the first command line argument, and the output file as the second command line argument.

    ruby ../lib/chisel.rb my_input.markdown my_output.html
